This course offers an introduction to fundamental software design skills essential for conducting artificial intelligence projects. You will learn various open-source softwares including Linux, Github, and popular libraries for data processing/visualization. We also briefly cover basics of machine learning in this class. This course is recommended for freshmen and is not recommended for senior students majoring in artificial intelligence/computer science/software.This course will be conducted in flipped learning. Students should prepare for the video lecture before class in advance. Offline classes focus on brief summary of the class, programming practice and question and answering.Important Notice !!** This course (AI design 01) is exclusively for undergraduate students in the Department of Artificial Intelligence. **** If you are a student in another department, including the Department of Software, you must enroll in class 02 (AI design 02)." **** If you are not a student of Department of AI and enroll to this class, you will get F. ****This course is primarily designed for first-year students. Students who are majoring in software/computer science/AI and are in their second year or above are strictly prohibited from enrolling in this course. If such students do enroll, they will receive an F grade.**
