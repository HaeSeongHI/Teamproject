Nowadays, most PCs, Smartphones, and Smart pads are equipped with multi-core processors (CPUs). - In this course, we will learn parallel processing techniques to utilize this multi-core hardware to enhance the performance of our program.- This course will be a DaVinci Learning course, thus students will watch the lecture video before class and will have quiz and pair programming sessions during class.- In-class activities will be announced in the orientation lecture.
